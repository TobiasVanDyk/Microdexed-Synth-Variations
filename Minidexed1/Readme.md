# Minidexed with Raspberry Pi 3B using a Waveshare WM8960 DAC hat and a 6N137 MidiIn

This is variation of the Minidexed 8xDX7 (Yamaha-DX7-Synth) by [**Probonopd**](https://github.com/probonopd/MiniDexed). 

It used the snap-close 3d-case made available there. Two changes were made: (1) This uses the i2s + i2c [**Waveshare WM8960 DAC**](https://www.waveshare.com/wm8960-audio-hat.htm) as [**discussed here**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/RaspberryPi-GPIO-Audio) and [**here**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Wolfson-WM8960-Arduino-Teensy-Driver), and sounds great. (2) A [**6N137 MidiIn**](images/6N137Midi.png) was also added. A list of the [**hardware and build intructions**](https://github.com/probonopd/MiniDexed/wiki/Hardware) are presented in detail there.
